When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

To make changes as such to create and edit plaintext files directly on GitHub website whenever on another system (or)
enable other persons to contribute to a project by pushing changes to GitHub.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?

While doing changes we will have first hand experience or knowledge of whatever changes are done by us or others and we can modify 
further with appropriate knowledge. +

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork-- allows you to make a copy of somebody else's repository dierctly on GitHub's server without pulling down the code to your 
local machine first. You can fork an existing repository and have it appear under your own with a single click.
Clone-- allows to download someone else's repository directly into your local machine or download/pull the changes from your own repository
(if or not it is forked from other repository) onto the local machine and Git will also create the required remote(origin) on your machine for you. 
Branch-- It is another version of the latest commit of the master introduced basically to make new changes and test before applying
the actual file. Help keep a project organized.
