When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

To make changes as such to create and edit plaintext files directly on GitHub website whenever on another system (or)
enable other persons to contribute to a project by pushing changes to GitHub.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?

While doing changes we will have first hand experience or knowledge of whatever changes are done by us or others and we can modify 
further with appropriate knowledge. +
